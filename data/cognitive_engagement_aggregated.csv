"Ah, so a little bit of my opposite then : D but if you enjoy your style as it is, then that's great I think! Unless you really want to be more stylish then trusting the process and stylization is the key for it. I think xD it's hard to say, since I have the opposite problem.",1

Yeah I meant figure drawing. Also for some reason when clothes get involved I get confused on how to add them. I can draw nude models as much as possible but for some reason when they have cloths I don't know what to make of it.,1
yes! so far it‚Äôs good but some lessons get me frustrated haha,1
Ah thank you so much! I did it and it looks so much better now,2
Thank you very much for that positive response. I definitely need to make the person stand out a bit more. Tbh the colour scheme wasn't predecided at all and randomly popped up in my head as I was making the piece so I'm really glad you like it. Once again thank you for your reply it means a lot!,2
Thanks! I try my best every day!,0
Will do when I have time thanks for the advice. Got lazy and didn‚Äôt mirror my image which is why the eyes came out like that. And just realized from another post I forgot to shade in the neck area lmao.,2

"&gt; Have you tried the smudging technique?

Well, my girlfriend learnt arts (including drawing) at high school, and her teacher taught them that smudging is not a good technique, and they should avoid it.
As far as I can see, there is no agreement in this topic online, some say it's ok, some say it's not ok :)
I will definitely try it",2
Thanks for the tips. I was actually going  to try animating this though.,1
"I started with portraits and find them more simple as I understand how skin reflects. It's different textures that throw me off.

I wasn't going for drawing accuracy for this specific one, as I free hand paint sketched (no pencil drawing). I got an email to be a teacher for paint socials and they wanted an acrylic portfolio (did one acrylic over a year ago. I have always done pencil and over the last year, watercolor). Given this, I didn't care about proportions and shapes, which I would make my main priority for portraits. 

Do you have any resources for color and light/shadows?",1
"Wow, I literally was looking at that book the other day in barnes and noble! Guess i will pick that book up right now. I haven‚Äôt had any training with learning shapes so I see that‚Äôs extremely foundational. Is it good to have a teacher to critique your work along your journey?",1

Thank you! I will!,2
Mainly I tried to draw a straight line from the the shackles to the corner of the page. Then I drew in the chains letting them go off course every now and then. Figured it would achieve a more natural look to the way the chains would hang.,1
"Thank you, I appreciate it and I‚Äôll try to get more experimental with the colors/hues - this piece feels very simply colored so I think it would definitely benefit.",2
Thanks! I will try to upload more work and I will give a look at those brushes.,2
Thanks for your feedback. They are supposed to be touching the ground. Maybe I'll rework the shadows to make it read better.,2

"this is gonna sound like im just lying or something but her anatomy wasnt exactly supposed to look realistic, it began as a cartoonish drawing. When I said that it was a ""realistic painting"", I meant to say it about the coloring. And no, I actually know how to draw hands HAHA i just made her with a claw to give futuristic vibes. But thanks anyway, constructive criticism is always welcomed haha 

Actually, if you mind, what do you think about her coloring? ",1
Yeah the blank space was definitely intentional! I used it to signify the emptiness and loneliness that these things make me feel. Thank you so much for your constructive criticism and compliment!,1
Its a stylized silhouette of a female form .,1
"Thank you so much for your comment, wow! Honestly, I have been doing digital painting for about 8 years and I feel like I have been learning a lot lately (pandemic has made me work from home for the past year and I have so much more time).

Oh okay thank you!!,0
"It‚Äôs all painted by hand. The model is painted from a reference photo, which was very interestingly lit, and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm replicating. The eye sockets are catching the light so much from her eye shadow reacting to it, which the rest of the face is lacking. I‚Äôm with you that it‚Äôs odd, but I like it because of that. 

Yeah, that‚Äôs a great call on the lighting with the flowers. I think by the end of paining all of the flowers I was just anxious to call it done, but it‚Äôs definitely worth revisiting.

"No problem, glad somebody else can see the *value* in them LOL",0
Whaaaaat that‚Äôs looks so good. Thank you for sharing with me! :)),0
"I did not paint on top of the photo. I make mask layers for skin, shirt, hair, ect. Then block in color with a wet brush then use a blending bush and sometimes a pencil brush for fine detail. I am not trying to misrepresent anything here. Here is the reference photo https://imgur.com/T3xiZwb",1

Just birds. But i think i'll add a ballon in the finished piece to make it less empty,2
"Thank you for your critique! I'll keep in mind to add more texture to the muzzle and shadows. more texture, less smooth :D",2
"Thank you a lot! :D With the background I simply used a big, heavily textured brush with around 20% flow and applied some light gradients and slight differences in hue, saturation and value to the base color (Creamy white in this case). The changes in color are incredibly subtle, I just play and blend around with the strokes until it looks right!",1
"Thank you! I only added an overlay layer at the very end at around 30% opacity and using a soft round brush to darken the tree in the foreground and lighten the grass on the right a bit. Other than that it was all done by painting, mostly on one layer working from back to front as I wanted to approach it as if I were painting with traditional media. The only exception was the tree in the foreground, which I painted on a separate later so I wouldn't have to repaint the background in case I messed up. Thankfully that didn't happen though",1
"I'd already made an edit that took out those stars! Too lazy to repost it but I hope to upload a compiled version of all 9 (Yes, Pluto still gets some love from me) in the future though!

I tried giving them more highlight and shadow but really struggled with how to add details to silhouette. I'll try and work on making them less flat next time. Also, you mean to say I should add some hard white light on the objects? 

I noticed that too with the texture of the clouds! I guess I relied too heavily on that Clouds brush in procreate. I'll try matching the texture next time. I had some difficulty trying to work in the froth/waves too, now that you mention it. Tried with the subtle white stuff at the edge of the water but it was always either too white or just looked like it was dropped on top of the water's edge/flat. I purposefully made that sky gradient diagonal though since the sunset was in the bottom corner. I don't know that's accurate or not tbh since most reference photos of the sunset have the sun centered.  
Really appreciate the input though! I'll try and work that into my next piece! Thank you!",2

"Mel is a so-called ""bootleg primagen"". In much the same way that *7 Grand Dad* is a pirated copy of a Flintstones game reskinned to pretend to be a Mario game, Mel is basically a cybernetic philosoraptor with a primagen head that was bounced around through some sketchy servers before he showed up here. Thus the baked-in Chinese subtitles and malware/denuvo invested ovipositor. Likewise, according to the lore primagens don't have GI tracts, so most of the time Mel has a bunch of duct tape over his asshole.

Like I said, I created the character as a joke.

The Chinese characters *probably* translate to ""fuck the police"", but with google translate you can never be sure. As for ""ECKS DEE"", it's just the old XD emoticon spelled phonetically.",1

"Thank you so much! Yes, it was quite difficult to balance realism and the original Levi features. I just made the pupils a bit smaller, hair more pointy, and bolder outlines. :) I also read that he has insomnia, so I tried to incorporate that into the realism too with the eye bags.",1
Thank you! I will definitely keep drawing,2
Ah I see what u mean‚Ä¶. My latest illustration was looking abit better but couldn‚Äôt really tell why but now kinda understand abit XD thanks,1
"I used a stump but it's very well used so should probably get a new one soon. But I'll keep this in mind, especially the overtone stuff sounds interesting. Thanks for your help!",1
I used pastel pencils. And I did make sure that they were very very sharp every time before use. The trick is about the many layers and balance among all of the colors.,1
Thanks guys! Was the hardest part honestly. Nice to hear it turned out alright :),1
Thank you! It was a commission for someone that was lots of fun to make.,1
"I‚Äôve heard this before. Which is why I‚Äôm also taking online classes on how to better understand shapes, and lines.",1
"Wow, you're right, there's indeed something wrong with the right arm. It actually does look a bit awkward in the original photo. The paw is really supposed to be pulled up that far to the head, but now that you say it, I seem to have messed up the proportions a bit in the vertical axis (i.e., ground to backside, not the axis either of us was thinking about), so where in the original it looks like it's gently resting on the body, albeit at a slightly awkward angle, the pose in my version looks like it needs muscle tension to sustain. That's a gesture error on my part.

Alas, fixing it would mean redrawing a large portion of the image, so I'll leave it at the slightly awkward angle. You have a good eye, thanks for catching that!",1
"Hi, sorry for the late reply, I did read your comment and added them to the artwork. You can see the update on my profile :D",2

Okay so the bisected figure was a bit of a happy accident that I feel works in favor of my intended sort of commentary on modern masculinity being this sort of dying thing. Being a 22 year old guy who is a painter and isn't at all really super masculine in a traditional sense I thought this commentary would be interesting for me to approach. This was the first painting in the series and the other one was the third. Essentially the idea behind this is a sort of disharmony and disconnect between the figure (masculinity) and it's surroundings (modern society). ,1
Thank you for the feedback! This helps a bunch.,0
"Hi, thank you for your comments! Regarding your question about the neutral colours, yes I'm mixing them. Mainly with Ultramarine blue and burnt umber for the greys and then adding titanium white for lighter tones. It may be the titanium that is washing it out and maybe making it too chalky? I may need to add a deeper transparent colour? I agree with adding reflective colour in the bowl. I did add some but maybe not enough.",2
Thank you!:),0
"Thank you! I see now that the grey tones don‚Äôt really work well with the brown paper, I‚Äôll try to use less white on the next one üëç",2

I bought ‚Äú figure drawing: design and invention‚Äù by Michael Hampton. It‚Äôs just hard teaching myself everything.,1
"Yeah I know... The perspective didn't have to be super extreme, i did both of those things,looked for reference and built the character inside of a box, (the horizon line is slightly above the feet in theory), but didn't taper the body  (what parts do you suggest I fix?)  and I feel like I didn't do the overlaps right, if at all...gosh this feels impossible ahah I've been studying perspective since this summer and I only get it right when drawing objects... plus I had already colored it when I posted so I doubt I can fix this one (I'll keep the advice for my next piece!), But I'd love to redo it all over again - maybe later on",2
alrightly i'll add 8 more thank you :))),2

Good point thank you! ,0
"Thanks for the critique! You're right, those overlapping forms are pretty confusing, especially considering their similar tone. I was hoping the trees would act as a point of contrast for the composition, but it looks like it failed haha. Good point on the hair, I should've rendered it with more constructive form and more back light. Thanks again, excellent points",2
"Thank you so much! I will definitely work on tones, shading, and light :)",2
"Thank you for the feedback! I didn't use liquify, I started off by adding the color values and shapes and then blended, then airbrushed over top. And with the hair I used the fine hair brush",1
"Hah the hair is the quickest part, really. It feels kind of ""cheaty"" in a way, but really I just block it out in a solid color, use a large soft brush to add some highlights and shadows. Then it's a bunch of quick light strokes and a bunch of quick dark strokes. It takes maybe 15 minutes total but looks pretty detailed.

You're right tho, quick is a relative term. I spent approximately 2 hours on each, which is quick for me.",1
Thanks!,0
"With painting, it's more about the different values / tones. I try not to rely on lines too much. Usually, there's an initial pencil sketch on its own layer. As I paint (on a different layer) I will lower the opacity of the sketch layer until it's barely visible, or I no longer need it and delete it. Any hard brush would give you a harder edge. I'm sure you could use pencil brushes and come up with some pretty neat effects.",1
"Firstt i tried to block in the shapes and the basic colours,  after that I tried to be accurate with the different shades and lighting. In the end I tried to create some details and texture",1
"the shading part, like, i dont know what to shade, where to shade and stuff",1

"My process is first to paint a diffuse shaded, maybe not even blended layer. Then I paint fur strands on top of that using the multibrush tool in Krita with the size/opacity round brush selected and set to 2-3px. Sometimes I'll slightly blur or airbrush the edges of the fur so it's not too defined looking, but I didn't have to do that much with this painting.",1
Of course! I‚Äôm not super experienced myself so I‚Äôll try to help but I would take it with a grain of salt. There‚Äôs a million ways to achieve the same result,1
"Well, in my experience from art school:
You get a cracked copy from somewhere and work with that, until you make enough money with it to buy into the ridiculous license bullshit.
But yeh, if you just want Photoshop, the 10$ deal seems like the best (I bought mine when it went for sale for cheap, but I'm not sure how often that happenes and it usually lasts only one year until you pay the normal price). There are legal PS CS2 copy floating around the net though, if you don't want your hands dirty. For simple drawing that version already does its job. The thing's I'd miss would be the magic lasso-tool (traces lines reeeally good) and automatic coloring stuff. You still have that, but the algorythm got a lot better.  
If you need more than one tool, you should think hard about getting the 40$/all-apps, because you'll already be near that price anyway.
Hope that helps.",1

sorry but this is a DTIYS or draw this in your style challenge! that persons drawing is also a dtiys from another artist too! the whole point is to take that idea and make it your own (:,1

"I agree a lot but I think it's a hard thing for me to come to terms with.

I know I don't need to use references but by now, since they are my only learning material, it's a habit I guess... I intend to try coming up with my own poses more from now on... Just like you said I'll get a sense for posing through that, eventually... 

I can see what you say about the ""drama""... I know the pose seems a bit stiff, it's true, I hope to get a better grasp of it also throw drawing my own poses more...

The thing with the background is that I feel that whatever I'll draw will be too dull, compared to the actual drawing, so I use open source images and incorporate them to the artwork... I'll try to the things you said all together (I'm tempted too) for starters!!! 

Thank you, once again, so much for your feedback and all the useful pointers... üôèüèºüòç

PS: As for the drapery pointers... I just can't find the way to make the folds look better.... I haven't studied a lot on the subject actually, so I either study or draw robots (no fabric, no problem üòâ)...",2

"Thank you! :D I'm glad you said it looks intentional. Sadly, although I love bright colors, I am terrible controlling the saturation of my colors so it's totally unintentional haha.",1
"Ah, thanks! I'll probably get back to you with more questions, but I'm wondering if you recommend drawing from the shoulder when on a 5.5inx8.5in sketchbook. I've been practicing it, but when drawing I find it hard to draw that precise even for the outline for something. ",1
You're spot on actually. I'm terrible at drawing faces and figures. I used to paint when I was in school. 18 or so years ago. Wanted to try out digital few months ago since I had an ipad. Mostly just using references and trying to reproduce them the best I can. What I do whenever I have time these days. I took my time with this one and did it over a few days.,1
"Thank you so much for these detailed advices ! I will apply them for sure ! 
What is wrong with my pressure? Are you telling me this because you can see the previous drawing through the page or is it something else?",2
"Thank you! Ahhh I think it‚Äôs Imgur that downgraded the photos. I‚Äôll retake them again some day !

You‚Äôre right. Perhaps something like:
1.        Draw blobs and basic shapes to set up scene 
2.        practice simplying core components to different level of fidelity 

Thank you so much for the tip!",2
sorry bout that i'll delete the comment!,2
"Thanks! I really appreciate that! I followed you back, I love your style!",0
Great advice on both the textures and scale. I appreciate it and will work on both.  Thank you!,2
"Thanks for the reply

I have seen that book before and it was informative, but not sure if there is another book taking the subject in more depth",1
"Yes, I need to get out of isolation soon, I'm doing this because I completely skip drawing eyes when it comes to finished works and instead just slot in some other concept in there to avoid failure. Proko's videos talk about keeping context in mind too, so that'll be the subject of my next study. Thank you so much.",2
Do you mean Hijab ,1
"Thank you for all the tips!! I think I get really carried away by over blending and I need to get a better sense of hard edges vs soft edges. And that includes the lip shadow. I added it there but I think I overblended it so it disappeared üò©. I need to remember faces have hard shadows and not everything is blended out. Thank you so so much for your insight!! And as for the hair, I will work on hard shapes for sure. Thank you again",2
"Thanks, I'll try experimenting with brushes and background colors. Only used basic and gaussian brushes for this, with a bit of ""pencil"" thrown in. Fur is my weak spot in general, so I cheat by picking a breed that isn't too hairy.",2
Thank you for your comment! I‚Äôve been at it with markers for about 2 years now and still don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm close to mastering them. Always learning!,1
Thank you! I find that it's the smearing that's the problem more so than the drips. But while ink pens are a godsend if you screw something up too!,1
"yeah!! disappointingly the canvas is only four inches tall, so it was really hard to get stuff finer. But i think that if i work on making it onto bigger canvases that should help with the issue! and thanks!!!",2

I've heard of people practicing with mirrors, is this a good way to go at it? I mostly find photos of faces from a few specific angles so I'm thinking it might be an idea",1

Thank you so much! I wasn‚Äôt very secure about this work haha,0
"Thank you for this! I never heard of these applications until now, and I think I‚Äôm going to set some time on playing some of these tools before I get into another perspective dilemma. Haha Thank you!",2
Do you think using line thickness to show shadows would be a good idea? I'm thinking I might mess around with that a bit.,2
"I did the shadow exactly how it was on the original, i only changed the body lol. thanks for the advice!",1

"i don‚Äôt know for sure but i would guess 16-24 hours based on the podcast episodes i listened to ? but it was done over about three weeks so i couldn‚Äôt say for sure :) !! this was done with graphite pencil, with a little black coloured pencil and black ink, and white gel pen, and in an artgecko a3 sketchbook (i love the texture!!) 

i don‚Äôt know anything about charcoal but if you‚Äôre into pencil i could still give you some pointers if you want !!",1
What this person says. Thank you.  I make my own. It‚Äôs less expensive and I can build whatever size I want. ‚úåüèª,1
"An earlier version of this drawing had harsher, bolder shadows. If you had to actively look for the shading I guess I shouldn‚Äôt have let my choice to cell shade with a soft brush make my shading so inconspicuous. Also, In the future I‚Äôll try to keep in mind the form of my character so I can emphasize its shapes. All-in-all thanks for the tips!",2
I don't think it's not serious to point things like that out. I appreciate the feedback.  (Although the subject has hips and a big ass) I'm not sure how to make it less cartoon looking. ,1
Thanks a lot for your help!! Appreciate it,0

"As for the RGB, It's chromatic aberration, i said that in the comment, I find it makes the chain pop out and gives it a sorta 3D effect, that's not for everyone tho

Ninja's historically wore dark blue, not black, dark blue camouflages with the night sky while black silhouettes, otherwise they'd wear normal farmer clothing

You literally made the association in this comment, I've asked more than a dozen friends, all immediately guessed cherry blossoms, so evidence suggests that just cuz the association is determined by being staples of Japanese culture and prevalent in anime/movies/comics doesn't seem to make it less obvious, so I guess you just aren't from the target culture

Your critique got me to work on it some more so thanks but I don't wanna get into a whole debate about association and ninjas, I just wanted to show off the updated version, sorry you didn't like it",1
oh nice idea! thank you,0
"Well... after many tries I knew I wouldn't do well with the chains so I opted in making the two links and copying them, also making them slightly bigger each time they were closer. I am happy that it looks to you as I intended to. Thank you for giving feedback üòä",1

Overall, I was looking for a little more of a see-through look, but yeah. Atmospheric perspective definitely plays a big role in my art. Actually, thinking about it‚Ä¶ I know atmospheric perspective, and I assume the two are the same concept under a different alias, but I have to ask just to be sure‚Ä¶ Is there a difference between atmospheric and aerial perspective‚Ä¶?",1
Haha thanks alot :). I also do NSFW and soft gore stuff too. If you want a commission I can make a good one hahah.,1

It's supposed to be a fantasy dwarf so some things like the torso and short shins are intentional, but the arms and right hand are kinda inconsistent with everything else.  I'm currently doing different studies on the figure and anatomy, most recently I studied hands.  I will get started on studies with greyscale, that sounds like it'll help me a ton.",2
Aww man thanks so much. That makes sense! With all the great answers I'm getting here I'll be sure to post an update when I'm done!!,2
"Thank you! It definitely helps. I am finding that I don‚Äôt really know WHAT to do or WHAT to practice, so it‚Äôs helpful to hear that I should be experimental and trying different techniques, even the ones that I think ‚Äúdon‚Äôt appeal‚Äù to me right away.",1
"Okay thanks for the advice! It was a lot to take in but I understand where you`re coming from. I started picking up sketching a few months ago and was looking at some guides beforehand on how to draw. I kept jumping from guides to drawing from reference because I was too excited on doing my first sketch. Im not sure if you know any good guides on how to draw the human anatomy I would be more than welcome to looking at. 

yeah idk where i got the idea of putting my signature on my art I thought it was pretty cool and i was also practicing on how i would sign stuff later on in the future haha ",1
"Thank you! During gesture drawing I really try to focus on the movement, so the anatomy sometimes turns out a bit (too) unrealistic  \^\^",1
"Thank you for the reply! That makes a lot of sense about posting one a day. And that's sort of the general rule I've been trying to follow at the moment because it's important that everyone gets there work seen and gets support and advice. And I don't want to take that away by spamming loads of work. 

I suppose I mainly like the contrast that I can achieve between pure white and black, as well as the process involved in creating them. the neatness of the linework and stippling is also a big factor as it really helps with making the image look clean and uncluttered. 

I think the way my idea shows through makes an impact as well. For instance I wanted this piece to be like a pair of sunglasses but I'm unhappy as I couldn't quite figure out how to make the lenses look like the had their own shading on too of the image inside them. I think lastly I like how the forms of the images come across and the styles I can experiment with such as with the mist below the mountains here, and the different ways I've attempted to draw clouds and mountains and trees.

That's all I can think of for a minute for the basic things. Thank you again for the help and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. It really helps me.",1
Thank you! I added some color and value variations and now it looks a lot better!,2

Your message is well received! This is a project for monochromatic painting. I will definitely play around with some complementary-ish colors to add some theme to it! Your idea is great!  I really appreciate !,2
"Dude, even if that‚Äôs just a joke, no ones laughing.

You don‚Äôt know if I may be going through hard times or just having a bad day.

This comment is offensive and is not making my day better and it wasn‚Äôt funny.

Be carful what you say to others.",0
"Thank you! The teeth were indeed a design choice, since i thought it would add a really nice element to her design (it reflects her personality well, plus without it her outfit is a bit plain =w=;;)",1
Oh thank you! I'll give that a try üòÅ,2
Thank you for the input! I‚Äôm definitely having trouble clarifying depth so this is helpful :),1
Awesome thanks for the great resource! I‚Äôll definitely keep this in mind for the next piece. I‚Äôve been so focused on the eye and eyelashes that I‚Äôve let other parts fall to the wayside as I learn.,2
"Yes ! Well spotted, beautifully shot movie, I have a few stills from it I'd like to use as reference",1
"That's awesome! No doubt you'll whip up something better than mine, good luck on the course!",0
Thank you for your input! I've begun a new piece already and I'm using a TON of references for it this time - it's a fan art topic to help build skill (ans gain a following) but I want it to turn out well. I appreciate your time,2
Thank you so much!,0
Thanks!,0
"Thanks for pointing that out! I didn't notice the blur on the eyes not being used anywhere else, now I know why it looks weird!",1
Thank you!!,0
Thanks for the help! I went with the sunset theme but good point on the character not being the main focus! I need to tone down that yellow in the background to make her pop out more,2
Ooo yes you‚Äôre right. I honestly didn‚Äôt even think of that. ,1
"I used a dark blue to shade, but guess I haven‚Äôt been brave enough with using it yet.

I made the mistake of making that blurriest tree first, before I figured out how the leafy brushes work.

Do you know any places that‚Äôd have good tutorials for specific stuff like brush strokes? I used to use DeviantArt but that place has become unnavigable.",1
"Wow thank you so much!! I was planning on making some test prints next week and I'm hoping to start selling them in April :) I'm going to post updates on my instagram, - I can message you when I put them up if you would like!",1
"Damn. That is some good advice. You're right, why did I make the shadow in light darker than the shadow in shadow? who knows. I love that idea of the smaller brush! Dude, honestly, do you ever have that where you're faced with a seemingly tough obstacle that you ruminate on for an unreasonable amount of time, and then you talk to someone awhile later, and you're like ""the answer was so simple!"" That is why I love critiques, and that is why I appreciate you. Thank you:)",1
You can do that?,1

Yeah I intend to stick with the simplicity of the design and thanks for the anti copy advice and i so intend to color it later on,2

It didn't look as good as I thought it would with the detached paws. I will fix that on my next drawing.,2

I don't know. I just really like to draw canines.,1
Thank you!,0
To keep from typing an essay you can read the post before this one if you like.,1
"I usually start with a base layer with the most prominent color (usually the skin or fur color), and outline the entire shape of the character (in the first picture I started with the off white fur color) and then I add base colors on top for accessories, clothes, marks, facial details, then I go over with lines for details such as folds, fur poofs, fingers, distinguishing different parts of the bodies, etc. I just choose a random color for shading and go with what feels right",1
I Gave it another go and I think it already works better!,2
Thank you ‚ù§,0
"I definitely agree and think you pointed out a common pattern which I feel myself is a major flaw in my art - stiffness. It's something which I've always stuggled with and I'm trying to improve! Similarly with hands, months ago I would have avoided them but I tried to go out of my way to still do them despite knowing this. Which might explain why these things are a bit wonky. 

Thank you for pointing them out, really helps with the perspective of things! ^^",2
Thanks for the feedback! I'll definitely do some more drawabox lessons and ease up on the texture brushes. ,2
"wow thats seriously confusing.... so would an Intuos Art Medium (what I'm assuming is now the equivalent of a bamboo) or an Intuous Pro (small? medium?) be more suitable, in your opinion? What is the difference between them qualitywise? Also, thank you for the help!!!",1
"Thank you. I searched for craft/painting advice subreddits and this one was suggested, but I can see how it‚Äôs now entirely relevant.",1
"ah no youve nailed it perfectly. The reference showcased a bit more tension on the thigh (The creases were horizentally taut) through some lighting. And while Ive put the lighting down it doesnt convey that slight stretch and tension over the thigh. 

Thank you for your insight, it really helped me finally figure it out",1
makes perfect sense! thank you v much sir,0
Thank you! I drew this on my phone used the app ibisPaint X !,1
"I already know that, I'm just asking if the general gesture looks real and not forced",1
Thanks for the encouragement and I'll try some videos to hopefully accelerate the process,2
Yeah I definitely see what you me. I kinda rushed through the left side lol! Thank you!,1
"XD it totally looks like it, yeah. A lot of the head shading got obscured by the smokey hair/halo thing.",1
"Well, it's not her, but in the process I thought 'I know this girl' and you're right, it does look like her! ",1
"Ah! Thank you for the advice! I was wondering what was wrong with the nose too. It just looked kind of off? I didn't think to look at the bridge (or whatever that area is called lmao!) I was concerned about the nostrils too. I played around with it after I posted this, but I thought it would be best to put it to rest for now. Pfft!

*And it is JK! I'm comforted that you were able to recognize that &lt;3* ",1
"this one supposed to be yakul and ashitaka, and I just end up drawing yakul and dont really add details haha",1
"tbh i never tried it yet. at least in my anatomy studies, ill do that next after i learn arm anatomy :v",2
thank u for your comment!! i‚Äôll keep this in mind:),2
"True! The problem for me is always getting the same mix of pigment again. Also, sometimes you have to call it done...",1
"Wow thanks for the advice! I really want to improve :) You mentioned definition, could you tell me how to add definition??",1
Thanks for pointing that out. It is in fact blocky! I'll work on it :),2
"That was beautiful and it was helpful, thank you :b",0
Im transitioning from pen and paper to digital. This was the look I wanted to go for on this piece since cartoon look is the only style I know how to do right now on digital. I would like to learn realistic and will probably give it a shot sooner or later. When I was drawing with pen and paper I would usually go for more of a realistic style.,1

"Thank you so much :) it was just a feeling, like something is missing",1
It does look a bit off back there haha! I'll probably correct during painting,2
"I wanted the character to be a little ripped/buff which is why the back became so developed, but I can see where you‚Äôre coming from on that. Definitely agree on the face, thank you!",1
I am! I have red blue yellow as well as white and black. I do feel like some parts came out really dark so I think next time I may use less straight black depending on what I decide to paint. Thank you!,2
Thank you so much!! Always love your feedback and this really helps put skin tones into a better perspective for me!,1
"I really appreciate that! I feel like there are some inconsistencies with the particular techniques I used on feathers in different areas but I actually started a new more ""realistic"" piece and I think that's where my ability is best put to use",1
would love that,0
Great link thank you. I can't find anything about this painting or artist online even with a reverse image search. I'm hoping it is an original but if it isn't I still love it; for three dollars can't go wrong. I appreciate your responses.,1
"Thank you very much! Good point on the lights, it might add some more depth when i delete/soften the lights on the mountain.",2

oil,1
"It means a lot to me that you gave this enough consideration go give this another look, thank you so much ‚ô•Ô∏è! And I really think you nailed it. I can see the confusion and loss of that dark, thick oil feel when I‚Äôm sticking to the original water reference photo. I‚Äôve decided to look more at the tones and thickness of the oil around her neck and arm and am excited to really shape this up! Getting feedback from someone removed from the start of the process has been incredibly helpful!",2
"Ahhhh I love you!!! I suck at drawing animals haha. And these birds were done free hand from imagination, realizing now that I should have used some references. Thank you for your post, it's very helpful and exactly what I needed!",2
No critique is invalid! everyone has an opinion thanks for your critique I‚Äôll take that into account when I make my next drawing,2
Thank you! Can I correct the pinky somehow in this piece? The material is egg shell and I also think it looks strange.,1
"Lol, well it is a terrible drawing of a cow!",1
Thank you so much!! ,0
I would love to somehow make it look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/Zqy3wcR.jpg). I love this style and the way it has some outlines but not completely. The way it's messy but outlined still. It feels like it's the perfect balance of structured chaos. ,1
Thank you for your input!  I'll keep practicing and do some more figure drawing in more dynamic poses.,2
Thanks for the tip! If you swipe right on the first image I‚Äôve included one that had crosshatching. Do you think the line weight tip could still be applied even with crosshatching?,1
"Thank you, and You're right I see that the left ear begins at the inner eye.",1

Uuuuh that's a great Idea!! Thank you :D,0
Thank you very much! I'll be sure to refer to this!,2
"Thank you for your advice! I just wanted to keep the background stark to make the subjects pop more. I hadn't really thought of making it similar in era, but that's definitely something to consider in the future. ",2

"Aye, I thought so too. Hamster wheel in my head has been whirring away since he said it ;)",1
Haha yes! Nothing beats the round brush!,1
thank you I'll give it a try on my next drawing! ,2
"Thanks so much! I also was finding the full body poses to not look quite right, but couldn't identify why. Now that you've pointed out the areas that need work, it seems clear as day, and I can hopefully improve upon it next time.

I've been reading about squash/stretch, and started on proper anatomy study, but it's early days yet so hopefully with some proper study and I can apply it better to my work.

I appreciate your time in helping out :)",2
"Thanks :) I used the mixer brush quite a bit - it has a smudgey effect, dragging and blending paint already placed on the layer. I recommend playing around with it. I have found it great for things with soft or insubstantial edges.",1
I would ultimately like to be able to do stuff like this https://i.redd.it/amqqj4ckock71.jpg if that helps?,1
Thanks for the reply! I gave this drawing a bit of time to rest while I practice values a bit more. Do you have any tips to practice values? what should I paint?,1
"I would say the biggest struggle was with anatomy, as I wasn't going off any references. I'd like to know what would make the characters look more appealing or interesting -- but I'm open to hear any critique!",1

Thank you! I did highlight it a wee bit but my monitor tends to skew colors too light so I now realize it‚Äôs hardly visible if at all on other devices. ,1

Yeah thats what i realized when i started using procreate... is that my flow is super important. I can sit there struggling to get the program to open the right brush or blend correctly. It just completely interrupts the entire process,1

"Thanks, it's a mixed collection but the majority used here are from an artist Aaron Griffin who has access to them through his artstation account",1
"Hi, thank you for responding! Using broader strokes to layout a foundation before adding details is something that is simple, but completely eluded me. I‚Äôll remember that in the future. I saw the hair brush in procreate and wanted to play around with it, which is what sparked this piece. I will avoid starting with the hair in the future and have a base. When tackling a piece like this I had no idea where to start. This reply has helped me get the proceeds worked out, thanks!",2

"You're ignorant. Do you even do any credible research on us? Your hate is unjustified and leans on wobbly pillars, and I sincerely hope that you don't live by the viewpoints you've described to me. I doubt you've even been listening to my reasoning, since you so badly want to be right, but guess what? You're not. The things you accuse us all of simply are not true, and the fact that you think we deserve hate is also inaccurate. ",1
"ye in my last post about it, youll find it on my profile, i mention the legs, but ill have to reproportion the torso and tail, and i feel its weird legs aren't worth fixing if it means sacrificing the torso and tail.",2

Alright then I will wait for you to send me whatever picture or drawing of your sona are you want I am just going to drop your for sona on a pose and just going to give you it for free,2
"I guess that's pretty much what happened to me here, haha. Still it's nice to hear from others even if my issue turns out to be obvious  in retrospect. Most people in life only compliment what I've done well in my art or laugh with me at the bad, but can't really offer tips or personal experience. So thank you kindly internet stranger!",0
I am actually inspired by jonghun shin. Will defenitlly check out Albert  Natmatjiras works,2
"Thank you! I've taken the comments in here into account and have widened the shoulders a bit which has helped, I think. I'm definitely going to add more definition to the eyes when I do the proper lines so I will bear that in mind; appreciate your comments! :)",2
Yeah I understand what you‚Äôre saying this was more simplified to sort of be pleasing to the eye and is a painting I taught at a drink and paint event so it‚Äôs not meant to be really complicated just something paintable and teachable in 2 hours to people who have never painted ,1
"Thanks, I‚Äôm only using school pencils and a classic eraser so I don‚Äôt have a lot to work with, I used my finger to smudge it up, my finger was pitch black by the time I was done lol, but I did only pick up drawing a couple days ago so... I think it‚Äôs pretty good for a first attempt",1
"Yeah, I kinda have a bad habit of drawing androgynous boys, so I tried my best to make Todoroki's hair a bit shorter like actually is. I don't have a dA or a facebook, but I've been thinking of starting one if I ever get better :)",1
"how i interpretated it is that my body is angled and the shoulder is hidden under my hair. but people pointed out that the foreshortening is a bit wonky, and i totally agree. haha. :) Thank you for the comment! :)",1
"I'm trying to do both bc I  also want to apply to med school and I think it might help sooner or later but I that's a good advice , I notice it takes significantly more do both .",1
Haha! Umm... That's not what was intended. But I can see how you could come to that conclusion.  Thanks for the honesty!,1
"It's worth trying, I was immediately thinking of artists I saw doing this technique. They use these big confident and bold strokes. Thank you. I was using the spread brush in paint tool sai, I think I chose the inappropriate one.",2
"I definitely agree.

I've had more trouble than I thought I would dropping the cartoon drawings and focusing more on things outside of my comfort zone, but anatomy is something I'm deadset on working on this year.",2

"you drew a perfect square first to draw the ellipse, that's what i meant.
to make sure it's a square you used the center as a 45¬∞ vanishing point and drew a line that goes through the diagonals of the square.",1

I am working on the details now and added more light and color on the focal point. It looks way better now. I can show you the result later if you want.",2
Thank you so much I appreciate it :) Yes I totally agree! Thanks for your reply ,0
"Thank you. I see what you mean about the vanishing points. They don't line up with the bars sleeves too. This is my first complex still life, so I figured there would be perspective problems, but couldn't tell where. That sink did give me trouble!",1

"Nice clean up...

None of this have absolutely nothing to do with you coming through like a reckless bull smashing up everything. The very fact that you said:

"That sucks! I can understand being frustrated that you paid money to go to school and not getting the education you wanted. If you really are interested in learning more about character design there are some really awesome resources online. I talk about schoolism all the time but there's also free lessons on youtube from channels like BAM animation, Phils design corner and Sycra. If I'm gonna be honest my character design class was extremely basic and most of my education came from the internet.",1
"It's not the fact that I'm getting harsh, good, okay, bad critiques it's the fact that this person is going above and beyond on micro critiquing a picture I took on the fly and that is probably distorted.

I feel like no one is listening. I wanted a critique, that's why I came to this subreddit. And I already said that I made the mistake not specifying what I was looking for in my critique and that was that I wanted to know what people thought about the frame and painting together. 

And thank you for the genuine input about the frame. I will take your words and reflect on them.",2

Ok thanks,0

Of course ! Might be a few weeks though,2

"Haha it doesn't sound crazy at all, I know exactly what you're talking about! You're spot on on the whole ""you don't need to add white to make it look bright, as long as everything else is a darker value"", that's something I'm still struggling with even though I'm aware of it. 
My value work could definitely use improvement, most of my work tends to come out either too contrasty, or too flat, too uniformly dark, or too uniformly light. I need to do some real value studies for sure, it's something I've overlooked a bunch in my learning process.

Thanks for the feedback, and for the kind words, appreciate it!",2

It's almost as though it's not an actual photograph!,1
"I have to argue about classical (or even abstract, at this point) painting being ""less effort"". Classical figurative painting is done from life, using fundamental understanding of form, composition, color, lighting etc. Photorealistic paintings are copied from photos, they don't require a deep understanding of such matters. Important distinction - I don't consider 17th century Dutch paintings photorealistic, for example. They're not photorealistic, they're simply realistic.

Sorry about being disagreeable, I just have some very strong opinions on everything art-related.",1
"wow, you brought up some great points. I'm definitely gonna work on making my lines and shadows more consistent, and I've been told before I should widen my range of values too, so you're totally right. Thanks so much for your time and the advice!",2

Do these mediums also make the paint more transparent?,1

1 layer hatch for the light area,

2 layer hatch for darker area,

and so on",1
"Thank you so much for the information! I seriously appreciate it, I‚Äôll check the sources you listed and see how it goes, honestly this artwork I‚Äôm doing I‚Äôve probably put around 18-25 hours into it which is way too much time lol",2

Thank you for your comment I will follow your advice",2
"I agree with you there, I'll definitely work on that in future.  To be honest most of the time I just start drawing without any planning, which I know isn't the best way to go about it. I'll try and do some rough sketches first next time. 

Thank you for all your help!",2

"Thank you very much!

I feel like I'm really struggling with highlights and depths, I'm too afraid it'll look too unnatural when I add to much, but I see your point.
I'll try working on that. Thank you!",2
mypaint an i'm using a one by wacom tablet,1
"But to me it is.

Thats my personal problem is that art and immediate family are all I care about. So when a significant portion of who i am is something i fail at than i have no answer to square that in myself as a person. 

Not getting into this earlier and working at it from a young age is the main source of resentment in myself and the environment around me. 

I am currently unable to cope with it.",1
"I did start with a basic sketch, then layer by layer added to that sketch various shading layers to get to the final product. I more or less followed much of the guidance given in the ""CtrlPaint"" series of videos.

I suppose where I found it difficult was in the ""adding more muscles and details""...I knew it needed it, but I couldn't seem to do anything that didn't just make the drawing look worse....Guess I just need to practice more!",2

do you mean like more defined and in a single direction?,1
"I truly cannot praise these challenges enough. You just have to make them sustainable. Something you can do every single day. Mine is just to draw something. (I have literally drawn a fancy ¬´NO¬ª cause I didnt want to draw that day, so I did it as a passive agressive thing. But I did it!)

I don‚Äôt have any specific goals, But as I am a beginner I look into lessons on YouTube or Skillshare or similar, since I have to draw anyway. Then I also have a few friends holding me accountable asking what I drew today. It really helps!",1

What do you mean by 3D-ness?,1
Thank you so much! I‚Äôll take this into consideration and try it out!,2
"Thank you for the compliment and crit!

It got really tough trying to push saturation without making the whole thing look overly garish, and I might have greyed out things too much where I could have laid down some pure unmixed pigment.

The greens, in particular, were difficult to get right (as they always are); I had very bright greens on initially but they started to look day-glo set against the darker background so incorporated a lot of red into my mixtures.  On the second pass, things went a bit too far in the other direction and the leaves were more brown than anything.  So I started again trying to balance my first two approaches, and it got close.  I could have employed a bit more deep yellow on the highlighting, though, I definitely agree there, and maybe some more blue or teal shadows to give the leaves a bit more dimensionality.",2
ty for your input!,0
" that makes sense. the character generally kills sea monsters but hes a whaler by trade. without context though, it doesn't connect",1
"I looked at a lot of human faces in the profile view, studying them by observation but I guess I should do some studies of them as well! your right I also think the forehead should be a bit bigger too, removing the brow bone was a stylistic choice but if it looks that weird I'll try adjusting it a lil bit. thanks!!!",2
What do u think,1

"I'm the artist and a woman, I rarely draw cheesecake, but it's been kind of slow commission wise and one of my friends said I don't draw enough 'sexy' stuff, and that's usually where the money is, but it just feels so boring and blah to me lol, I dunno. I don't like it. I was expecting so much criticism and harsh comments telling me how bad it is but that is not the case surprisingly.",1

Thank you for the feedback. I really appreciate it and do agree. I did want it to be a statement (as it was in life) but in the photo the subtle shifts in tone do not show up well.,1

Thanks not done yet though. I plan to add an extension took makes look like pulling something.,2
Yeah I just noticed that looking back. The lips have more of a smile on mine. : - ),1
Thanks! It's actually just a drawing brush. Came in a pack of other drawing pens from Faber Castell. :),1
Thank you! That means a lot to me!,0
Thanks. It‚Äôs actually supposed to be over the iris too but it‚Äôs hard to tell.  The pupil is the more blue circle. The whitish areas are supposed to be over the iris but I see that it‚Äôs hard to tell that.,1

Oh okay. I didn‚Äôt know what a vanishing point was before I started the drawing so I didn‚Äôt know that I had to do that haha. So a vanishing point is the point where everything seems like it‚Äôs farthest away right?,1
"Thank you for the reply! I've seen Huion for sale as well, specifically the H610 one. I've seen great reviews about it, and it seems goo when it comes to pressure sensitivity, wideness and having a rechargeable pen. Although, I'm having a few doubts choosing it because people say Huion tablets tend to last only for a few months while Wacom go for years. Plus, they also say the usb port gets a bit loose(?) and the drivers are buggy.

It is cheap though, but if it were to break I'd have to earn a long time before getting a new one again. Sorry for the negativity, gosh, it's what I've been seeing when these two brands get compared. I can't really be sure though as I've personally never handled either of the two. But between a Bamboo Splash and a Huion, which would be worth more to buy?",1
Thanks üòä,0
"I won't be going back to that piece, but all replays give a lot of feedback on what to look out for in the future
Also setting every new art as wallpaper helps with finding and  remembering all mistakes in it",2

"Hi sorry, let me clarify. I‚Äôve been a photographer for years, and I‚Äôve used photoshop for photography related reasons for years too. 

I photo bash then paint over the reference image and apply lighting shading etc in Lightroom then paint over that again to help blend it together. 

So although I‚Äôve got some experience in the photography world, I‚Äôve never made any art like this, or photo-bashed before, or digitally painted like this.

I get it‚Äôs hard to believe internet strangers, but this is my first tentative step into the digital art world and communities, but you have my word my first photo bashing arty drawing/painting started 4 days ago, I find the workflow super fast because of my experience in photoshop and just using the tools there makes the photo bashing element of them pretty quick. 

I‚Äôm sorry if you don‚Äôt consider photo bashing and then painting over it to be art but I guess my shitty filters are subjective to me and I enjoy and like it, if there‚Äôs a more appropriate community you can point me to let me know",1
It‚Äôs included! The shortcut for it is ‚Äúb‚Äù and shift+b will get you the blob brush that works a bit different but is another option. Then when you have that open you can even select different brushes through a drop down menu in the window. When I‚Äôm not on mobile I can probably screenshot it if you want!,1
"Yeah, I felt something was off with the skin tones, but yeah now I see it. Thanks! Will keep this in mind next time",2
"well that's kinda rude  
the reference photo was a similar shape",1
"ye youre right about the wonky glasses. going from my ref image I think I fucked up the angle of the head and he's looking more towards the camera. I'm gonna revise this in a few months after more practice.


I also feel like I just need to adjust the right lense more but the left one looks okay?",2
Sure! this is a flame from a gas fireplace that had glass stones. They are clear blue I really struggled with getting them to appear glassy and blue.,1
all very valid points. noted. thank you!,0
"Thank you for your reply! I know Ryan Church is really big in the world of concept art. He's done stuff for Star Trek, Transformers, and Star Wars.

I'll definitely take a look at the tutorials. You're right: A lot of these images could be produced using 3D Modeling software.",2

"For real. Thanks man, same to you!",0
"There is a lot of positive discussion here but I want to address this. 

I have spent literally years learning to draft anatomy and portraits from scratch. I have proven it completely that I am capable of it. Did it make my final product any better? No. Did it double my work time? Yes. Did it leave me exhausted before I even got to begin expressing myself? Yes. 

So you‚Äôre absolutely right. I decided to trace my foundation because it relaxed me and let me focus on my art. 

My process after the construction doesn‚Äôt change at all. I‚Äôve just let Mother Nature do the work for me. 

There is so much stigma about what is and isn‚Äôt art. You‚Äôve got my reference. Trace it. Show me that it didn‚Äôt take all my years of knowledge and practice to make the decisions I made all the way through to create something unique.",1
"Hey arifterdarkly,

As this is my second painting I primarily studied proportions and how todraw hair. You are right on the lighting being flat and subtle, I realized thatrather late but it was no issue for me, I at least learned a lot about softedges in color/lighting.

The primary reason for me though why I chose the reference was that itcame close to a picture that I saw in a dream of mine and that I wanted toexpress for quite a long time already (the b/w + blue eyes one). If it wasn'tfor that I would agree with you that emotions and also indirect viewing angleswould be much more interesting.Thanks for taking your time to comment :)",1
