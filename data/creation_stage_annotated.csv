Need some help on improving my portrait drawing. (feels washed out),"I'm new to digital painting, well painting in general. I usually make vectors and now that I got a drawing tablet I always wanted to create some portraits in digital paint. I'm using the trial version of Clip Paint Studio 


I was following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l3uyUlu3dc). My ultimate goal is to reach something like his work, it's truly stunning!

&amp;nbsp;



So I started with [this initial sketch](https://i.imgur.com/RyPxyox.png), I think the sketch worked out pretty nicely and looks clean (except the hair, ignore that). Then I added some colors as he did in his video, if I keep the sketch lines on with it [looks okayish](https://i.imgur.com/uZvUDO1.png). But as soon as I take off the sketch lines the portrait [becomes washed out and very unrealistic](https://i.imgur.com/sszsG6t.png).

&amp;nbsp;



Now I'm wondering where did I go wrong? Did I use the blend tool too much? Can anyone give me some advice? What can I improve? What should I focus on? What am I doing wrong? What brushes should I use (currently have the default ones) I've [uploaded the file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5psvf7lmvieg8ow/illustration.clip?dl=0) on my dropbox if anyone of you guys would have time, feel free to take a look and tell me what I can improve.

first painting...ever,"So this is the first painting I've done since probably fifth grade when I was forced to in art class.

I never had any confidence in my artistic ability... always thought I was awful at painting/drawing, etc... and that isn't too far from the truth. But, I suddenly had an urge to create something and in the back of my mind, the idea of putting paint on a canvas seemed kinda fun and therapeutic... even if it does come out looking terrible. So I bought some paint and canvas and used old makeup brushes and glitter to create this today. The glitter is actually highlighter that I wear when I party sometimes... so it changes color with the light and is sort of holographic. I just kinda dusted it on the paint. 

It certainly was fun but I can use some tips and criticism to develop some way or another. I would like to add more depth and texture to this moon... I'll probably do another one.
